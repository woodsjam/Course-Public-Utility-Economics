# Presentations of Utility Topic

+ You have chosen topics
+ You have a 30 min presentation to do during the last two weeks of class.
+ There will be three per day for four class days.


# In Class

+ Three people do presentations
+ All in attendance will be asked:
    + Evaluate content
    + Presentation  overall
    + Ability of person to respond to questions.
    + Pick one of the three as the best.
    
Note that there is some strategy on how to choose days.

# Day Preference Procedure

+ Rank the four days
+ I will randomize the order of the slips.
+ Give people first choice until slots in day are gone.
+ If your first choice is unavailable:
    + Give you second choice
    + If that is unavailable, third.
    + etc.
