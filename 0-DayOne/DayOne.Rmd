# Plan for the Day

+ Walk through the syllabus
+ Walk through tools and resources
+ Take a pre-test
+ Talk a little about microeconomics as time permits

# Syllabus

You can find the syllabus here. (https://github.com/woodsjam/Course-Public-Utility-Economics/blob/Winter2019/SyllabusPublicUtility.Rmd)

Almost all the slides will also be on github. (https://github.com/woodsjam/Course-Public-Utility-Economics/tree/Winter2019)

+ Download them before each class if you like but they are not a substitute for coming to class.


# Course Description

> Examines the rationale, economic principles, and institutions of historic economic regulation. Contemporary theory of the firm and regulatory practice with a focus on energy are analyzed. Prerequisites: Ec 311 or Ec 415. 

+ Fundamental problem is preparation
    + Undergraduate Students
        + Typically had 201 or 311 but not econometrics
        + Often the 311 skills  are pretty weak.
    + Graduate Students
        + Typically have no background in economics
        + May have very strong math skills -- if they come from engineering.

# The Solution

Solution is to teach the microeconomics and econometrics needed to understand the material  -- but no more than that.

In short, make it easy for someone to help you.

+ Rants and bellyaching put you at the bottom of the queue or off the queue.

+ Set Do Not Disturb times.
    + Defaults to 10pm -8am
    + You may miss notification of class cancellation.

+ Other material will be available through the library.  
+ Links are in the syllabus including the other textbook.

# Assessments and Grade Policy

Your grade in the class will be based on your performance on homework assignments and two exams.  

+ Final Exam (30%)

+ Regulatory or Utility Topic Presentation (10%)


# Homework

+ Homework may also take the form of an in-class presentation on a course topic.

# Exams

+ Open book and open note.  No electronic resources are allowed. 
+ I will bring copies of the textbooks  for you to consult.
+ Some questions will be computational and some will require essays.

# Question from Last Year

1. Suppose a utility has an old, 1910, coal generating plant that is on the historical registry. There are a few like this in real life. Given the cases and regulatory laws you have seen, which of the following actions would be allowed and why.
    + Convert the building from a generator to a substation.
    + Knock down the building a replace it with a modern Combined Cycle Natural Gas plant.
    + The city could seize it, without compensation, for public use as part of a museum.
    
# Lets try the Pre-Test

+ We are going to do this one question at a time.
+ Brief answers will be given today
+ Will guide how much microtheory we do in class.

# This Class is Small

+ Allows for a lot of customization.
+ Lets run the room, get names, and what you intend to get out of the course.
+ As time permits, look at the pre-test.
