# Course Description

The official description of the course is:

> Examines the rationale, economic principles, and institutions of historic economic regulation. Contemporary theory of the firm and regulatory practice with a focus on energy are analyzed. Prerequisites: Ec 311 or Ec 415. 

This is a companion course to EC 438/538 which will address the consequences of energy use and production, and EC 428/538 which is mostly focused on program evaluation, including energy conservation programs.

## Prerequisites

The undergraduate section has only the microeconomic theory as prerequisites.  The graduate section requires only graduate standing.  

This means that homework and lectures need to be tuned to three groups: 

+ Undergraduates that may have limited knowledge of microeconomic theory and econometrics.
+ Graduate students outside of economics that have significant math background but little or no background in microeconomic theory and econometrics.
+ Economics graduate students.

There will be times when the material may seem over your head mathematically (undergraduate) or the intuition is not coming through (non-economics graduate students), but I will do my best to keep the course balanced and moving forward with some class time spent on math or microeconomic theory as needed.

Any technical skills that students are missing will be supplemented with in-class tutorials and homework assignments.

## Key Dates

+ Midterm: Feb 5th
+ Final Exam: *Thursday*, March 19	12:30-14:20.
+ Last Day to Withdraw or Change Grade Option: February 23rd.
+ Holiday: January 20th

# Contact Information

Communication will be handled through slack https://utilityeconw20.slack.com. You should have received an invitation, if not just go to that URL and use your @pdx.edu email to sign up. There are reasonable help documents to get you started. https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users

Slack will be used for IM, email and forum style communication.  It even handles phone calls. If you have a question about course material or the course itself, ask in one of the channels. If you have a personal message that is not intended for others, send a direct message.

Office Hours:

+ My office is in CH 241-O.
+ + Drop in office hours are Monday 3:00 PM - 4:30 and Tuesday 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM through the last week of class. There is no need to make an appointment for these hours -- just come.

# Textbook and Other Resources

The main text for the course is Lesser, Johnathan A. & Leonardo R. Giacchino. Fundamentals of Energy Regulation, ed 2. Public Utilities Fortnightly, 2013. It was chosen with undergraduates in mind and illustrates many of the concepts they learned in EC 311/415. 

This text will be supplemented with journal articles and books available electronically through the library.

# Assessments and Grade Policy

Your grade in the class will be based on your performance on homework assignments and two exams.  

+ Final Exam (30%)
+ Midterm  (30%)
+ Homework (40%)


## Homework

There will be several assignments over the term.  All will be equally weighted and are intended to be completed by an individual. When written, they will be due Sunday at 11:59pm on D2L to avoid confusion. 

Homework may also take the form of an in-class presentation on a course topic.  This will typically be a shared experience, focusing on one of the assigned readings. Students will focus on related literature, mathematical models, or statistical analysis depending on the skill set of the students.

## Exams

Exams are open book and open note and can best be  described as old-school show-off-what-you-know questions.  Examples will be handed out a few weeks before the midterm.

Please bring a laptop to class on exam day. You will be submitting your exams on a google doc that you write in class supplemented with paper diagrams and math.
