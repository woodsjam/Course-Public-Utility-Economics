# Course Description

The official description of the course is:

> Examines the rationale, economic principles, and institutions of historic economic regulation. Contemporary theory of the firm and regulatory practice with a focus on energy are analyzed. Prerequisites: Ec 311 or Ec 415. 

This is a companion course to EC 438/538 which will address the consequences of energy use and production, and EC 428/538 which is mostly focused on program evaluation, including energy conservation programs.

## Prerequisites


The undergraduate section has microeconomic theory, EC 311, or the calculus based version, EC 415, listed as prerequisites.  The graduate section requires only graduate standing.

As with most economics courses, the more background you bring to the class, the more get from the class.  For this class, it means bringing a background in microeconomic theory and econometrics.  Not all students will have a background in both and many of the graduate students from outside of economics will have neither.


# Contact Information

Communication will be handled through slack https://utilityeconw21.slack.com. You should have received an invitation, if not just go to that URL and use your @pdx.edu email to sign up. There are reasonable help documents to get you started. https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users

Slack will be used for IM, email and forum style communication.  It even handles voice calls. If you have a question about course material or the course itself, ask in one of the channels, e.g., #general. If you have a personal message that is not intended for others, send a direct message, i.e., @woodsj. The group has global do not disturb hours of 10pm - 8am.  If you would like something different, alter your personal settings.


Please note that I am not online all the time, and when I am online I will prioritize well-phrased questions with sufficient detail.  I tend to ignore general complaints, questions that can be answered by reading the syllabus or using the search bar.

Office Hours:

+ There are no in-person office hours this term.  We will use Zoom to meet face-to-face. 
+ Drop in office hours are Monday 3-4pm and Tuesday 10am-Noon through the last week of classes. I will keep a Zoom meeting up during this time.
+ You can schedule one-on-one meetings at https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/.

# Textbook and Other Resources

The two main texts for the course are:

+ Viscusi, W. Kip, et al. Economics of Regulation and Antitrust, Fourth Edition, MIT Press, 2005. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=3338843.
+ Lesser, Johnathan A. & Leonardo R. Giacchino. Fundamentals of Energy Regulation, ed 2. Public Utilities Fortnightly, 2013. 

These will be supplemented with journal articles and books available electronically through the library.

# Assessments and Grade Policy

We have all had some experience with remote learning by now and have seen the general lack of productivity and the walls of students with mics and cameras off.  I have experimented with breakout rooms, but those fail quickly when students are unprepared either because they have not kept up with their reading or have not reviewed material from prerequisits for this class.  Rather than shaking my fist at the sky in frustration, I'm embracing the problem as a silent meeting.

Silent meetings were a reaction to people not having read the material and treating discussion like a scene from a martial arts movie where the group of attackers wait one at a time to attack the protagonist.  The fact is, we have not always read the material and we all want to talk and ask questions at the same time except when someone asks, "Are there any questions?"  

The regular class periods, which will be held in zoom, will look a little strange.  About a week before the class meeting, the reading for the day will be scheduled. This could be a chapter or one of the journal articles.  I will outline the reading in a google doc with topic headings that closely match the topic headings in the reading. Students will be assigned these sections in round robin fashion and it will be your job to create part of a table read.  Which is a document about six pages long, that summarizes the arguments in each section, criticizes those arguments, provides some criticism, perhaps a worked problem, links to background material and references, and a few question prompts for other students.

That section is yours.  You own it.  You are the expert and you will get a grade on how well you did constructing that section.

The table doc will be available to the class at least two days before the meeting.  Students can, but are not required to, read the document ahead of time and ask clarifying questions with the comment function in google docs.  The owners may respond to these questions or adapt their text to respond.

When class starts, we will all focus on the table read and, well, read it.  Continuing to ask for clarifications and helping other people out when they have questions.  This could be as simple as a link to a definition, or perhaps outlining a good response to the document to add as an appendix, where we will generally keep worked examples and detailed mathematical logic.  If someone needs some more detailed help, we can put them in a zoom breakout room with the owner of the section.

We will then break out of silent mode each owner will then summarize the discussion and answer some of the questions that were asked in the first pass.  The owner will then delegate some of the suggested fixes to other students while fixing a few on their own.  We will then finish some of the delegated tasks, which could involve a few people jumping in a breakout room to come up with a solution.  We will then repeat that process until we are done.

These table reads will remain live for the rest of the term and can be used as a reference for the homework assignments and exams.
