## Objectives

+ Need some idea of how we get natural gas and electricity
+ Need to know some of the ways we regulate those two at both state and federal level
+ Some background on Distributed Generation

# Natural Gas

## Where is it produced? Just conventional
![](http://dualstack.prod-http-80-test-412114078.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/w/images/1/13/EIA-conventional-gas.pdf)

## More in the shale areas.
![](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2015.04.17/main.png)

## How do you move it within the US? Pipelines (Interstate only).
![](https://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/images/dependstates.gif)

## What about those pipelines?
+ There are more intrastate pipelines than shown, plenty in TX and CA but also other states
+ Read more here https://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/transcorr.html
    + Picture pipes ranging from a foot to three+ feet for trunk lines.
    + Compressor stations every 50-100 miles, ~1,500 total
    + 200 psi to 1,500 depending
+ They are privately owned https://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/MajorInterstatesTable.html
    + Open access, posted prices, is a thing.
    + For intrastate, within, state PUC regulate
    + For interstate, FERC regulates (You can find current Tariffs at http://etariff.ferc.gov/TariffList.aspx)

## Compressors

![](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/files/2014/08/Compressor2-620x410.jpg)

## Compressor Station

![](http://www.gdacoalition.org/GDAC_Images/CompressorStation1.JPG)

## Storage is important

![](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2015.11.16/chart3.png)

## Most Storage is just old gas wells

![](http://www.energyinfrastructure.org/~/media/energyinfrastructure/images/ng-storage/updated-2-18/typeofngstoragegraphic-218.png?la=en)

## Storage is very seasonal

There is a weekly report on storage by EIA http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/nw2_epg0_swo_r48_bcfw.htm

+ Note the seasonality
+ Note the factor of 2+ changes over the term


## Hubs, where transactions are made
![](https://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/images/MarketCenterHubsMap.gif)

## Part of Henry Hub LA

![](http://www.2b1stconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Henry-Hub-Picture.jpg)

## Getting to Prices
+ You will see wellhead prices, but
+ Most references prices are at the hubs.
    + Henry Hub in LA is the most common reference hub for prices
    + There are fairly firm relationships between other hubs and HH except when there is congestion.
    + Changes in the usual difference are usually called basis blowout. Term is not specific to energy.

+ Intercontinental Exchange for Gas Itself
    + https://www.theice.com/products/OTC/Physical-Energy/Natural-Gas
+ FERC for transportation tariffs (Regulated)
    + http://etariff.ferc.gov/TariffList.aspx
    + Some are fixed and some have a market rate component.

It is hard to talk about gas separate from transportation.

# Electricity

## What Makes Electricity Interesting

+ We somehow start with a fuel (Counting wind, geothermal and sunlight in this).
+ Transport it from where we found it to a generating facility.
+ Turn it into electricity losing some energy as heat.
+ Run it along long wires to where people want to use it, losing yet more energy.
+ From there send it out to every small location (losing more), and
+ Because electricity is not _easily_ stored, adjust the rate at which we generate electricity moment-by-moment to make sure there is just enough.

This is a logistical miracle.


## Basic Units

+  $Watts = Amps Volts$ first thing everyone learns.
    + Pro tip on units, if it is someones name, capitalize it.
    + Volt is analogous to height.
    + Amp is analogous to a weight.
    + Watt is what it happens when that weight is dropped from that height.
    + DC is easy; AC is "complex"
+ AC because it is a wave, has a few more components.
    + Real Power, measured in W, it is what does the work.
    + Reactive power, measured in volt-amps (var),"r" tells you it is reactive, is what pushes the electricity around.
    + Apparent Power, is in volt-amps too (VA) is when you add the two together in a vector sense.
    + Power Factor is the Real(W)/Apparent(VA), the sign is interesting because assumes induction.

## What?

Caveat IANAE and I will do thing like call current amps and the like. Also, this is the simple, single phase, view with lots of simplifications. Reality is for engineers.

+ The alternating part of AC is what causes the complication.
    + You can talk about instantaneous power but
    + Tend to talk about average power.

+ With a resistive load, think light bulb, amps and volts are in sync
+ Inductors and Capacitors throw amps and volts out of sync
    + Capacitors store energy in electric fields. Think a very burst battery.
        + Amps peak _before_ volts
    + Inductors store energy in magnetic fields. Think about an electromagnet in a motor.
        + Amps peak _after_ volts

## Picture for this

![](http://images.slideplayer.com/17/5297074/slides/slide_27.jpg)

source: http://slideplayer.com/slide/5297074/


## Power Factor

+ Measure it
    + Henrys are the unit for inductance/capacitance and engineers use that in calculations
    + There are also power factor meters
    + You can also check out the difference between amps and volt on oscilloscope.

+ Low numbers mean the utility needs to generate more power than customer uses.
    + Can happen with low load, like a motor barely moving, but you still need the electromagnet
    + Common solution is to install capacitors somewhere to cancel out the inductor

## Why do we care about reactive power and power factors?

+ Engineers have to design systems to accommodate not just the real, but real plus reactive, i.e., apparent power.
+ Reactive power has to be generated.
+ Not residential tariffs, but commercial and industrial tariffs charge for reactive power or have penalties for low power factors.

## kW vs kWh

+ kW is instantaneous and called power
+ kWh is the integral over time and called energy.

+ 100 W light bulb uses 100 Wh = 1/10 kWh per hour

+ Get used to flipping between 1,000,000,000 W =  1,000,000 kW = 1,000 MW = 1 GW

## Lets Generate Some Electricity

+ Turbine -- spin something in a magnetic field to induce a current.
+ Lots of ways to spin a turbine
    + Coal, grind it up, burn it, make steam, use steam to spin the turbine.
    + Nuclear, use the heat to make steam, use steam to spin a turbine.
    + Biomass, burn stuff to ...
    + Gas, burn it to spin a turbine ...
    + Fuel Oil or Diesel
    + Solar thermal, use the sun to make steam ...
    + Water, falling water hits a turbine and spins it
    + Wind, spin a turbine
    + etc.

+ Or don't spin a turbine and go for photo-voltaic, PV.

## Characteristics

+ Nameplate, fully loaded under ideal conditions (MW)
+ Ramp rate, how fast power (MW) can change MW/min
    + Not always constant, can differ by capacity factor (fraction of nameplate)
    + Not always symmetric, up different from down.
    + Used to follow the load.
+ Heat rate, BTU in/ BTU out, only used for generation that uses a fuel.
    + 1 is impossible but 1 kW = 3412 BTU.
    + Recent average from EIA, https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_08_01.html

## Coal from the outside

![](http://appvoices.org/images/uploads/2012/02/Asheville-coal-plant-e1432059203783.jpg)
Source: http://appvoices.org/images/uploads/2012/02/Asheville-coal-plant-e1432059203783.jpg

## Coal on the inside

+ Pulverize the coal, picture something that can do 20 Tons/hr
+ Blow it into combustion chamber to burn
+ Steam turns turbine, etc. https://youtu.be/IdPTuwKEfmA

+ Clean up
    + NOx with ammonia common but plenty of others
    + Recover fly ash and sell it, great for concrete.
    + SOx, Mercury and other.  BTW Radiation

## Nuclear

Radiation to heat water and then ...similar to coal.  Just a reaction chamber

![](http://www.nuclear-power.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/inside_core.jpg?11abca)

## Local Reactor Columbia Generating Station


+ 1,170 MW usually runs as load following.  It reacts fast enough.
    + France is ~70% nuclear and they load follow.
+ Most nuclear is run as base load, i.e., all the time since low variable cost and high fixed cost.
+ Palo Verde (AZ) is larger 3.3GW

## So, about nuclear

+ So what to do with spent fuel.
+ They probably produce less radiation than coal
+ Can produce cheap, in the marginal cost sense, power.  More on this later.

## Natural Gas Conventional and Combined Cycle

+ Combined cycle means
    + Taking more than one pass at extracting energy.
    + Spin the turbines first.
    + Take the heat and run a steam turbine.
    + Take the remaining heat and use a different working fluid (with different phase change properties) to extract more.

+ CCNG
    + Plants are more expensive
    + Have lower heat rates, which means more efficient.
+ Conventional
    + Cheap
    + Commonly run as peaking units.

## Biomass

+ Tend to be combined heat and power. Another way of using waste heat.
    + Cogeneration like this is common.
    + We have steam and chill water systems on campus
+ While renewable, it is not, in general, clean
    + Particulates
    + Heavy metal concentration
    + etc.
+ All this is improving.

## Biomas One in Eugene. 30 MW and keeps catching on fire.


![](http://www.woodbioenergymagazine.com/magazine/2009/summer/images/article-biomass-one-001.jpg)

source: http://www.woodbioenergymagazine.com/magazine/2009/summer/article-biomass-one.html

## Geothermal

+ Drill a hole down to where the temperature is high enough.
    + If it is dry, add water to make steam.
    + If wet, get steam
    + If temp is not high enough, use a few working fluids to generate electricity.

+ Run through a turbine.

## Neal Hot Spring in Malheur. 30 MW

![](http://geo-energy.org/images/plants/Aidlin.jpg)

## Diesel and other Fuel Oils

+ You know the drill ...
+ Less than 1\% in the US for electricity generation.
    + Still common heating fuel.
    + Backup fuel for NG generation
    + May be used in small distributed generation
+ More common in less developed countries

## Solar Thermal

+ You have see the low and mid temperature designs for heating and cooling.
+ High temperature designs are:
    + Dish
    + Tower
    + Trough

+ Fluids:
    + Oil
    + Salt
    + Water steam
+ Low and mid temperature are similar to roof top residential that you have seen.

## Hydro

So, you spin a turbine

![](http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/hydro%20copy.png)


## Hydro can be complex

+ Many constraints
    + Intra and interseason storage requirements
    + Temperature and turbidity constraints
    + Treaties and contracts
    + Minimum and maximum flow constraints
    + Dredging
    + Water quality


+ Can you go all hydro?
    + US ~6\%
    + Norway ~95\%

## Everything Comes with a cost

![](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/hetchhetchy/pages/33/attachments/original/1415484942/taber_w_caption.png?1415484942)

## Wind

+ You find a good wind resource NREL Class 3 and up (http://www.nrel.gov/gis/wind_detail.html)
+ Put up a suitably rated 1.5MW windmill. 8MW is the largest I've hear about.
+ Maintain them, upgrade them and if need be demo them.

+ What people complain about
    + Noise -- Can't hear after a mile or two
    + Raptor and bat kills -- Less now with larger slower moving designs.
    + Ugly -- In in the eye of the beholder.

## PV

+ Does not spin a turbine.
+ PV effect generates DC electricity which is then converted to AC though an inverter

## Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and Levelized Cost of Avoided Electricity (LACE)

+ https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/archive/aeo15/pdf/electricity_generation_2015.pdf Table 1
    + CC is Carbon Capture.
    + CCS is Carbon Capture and Storage
    


# Distributed Generation


## DER vs DG

+ DG = Distributed Generation
+ DER = DG + Storage

May seem like semantics but small storage grew in potential since 2005

##  What is in DER

+ Definitions vary but Small (< 49MW) generation seems to count with < 1MW most common.
    + Plenty of renewable
    + Small turbine
    + Backup generators
    + Battery banks.
+ Combined Heat and Power
    + Steam Generation
    + Chill Water
    + District Energy
    
## Why Would I (Private) Build It?

+ Power Quality
    + Equipment is sensitive to voltage drops or spikes
    + Equipment is sensitive to frequency variation.
    + Wave shape and harmonics
    + High reactive power needs (Often avoids utility charge.)
    
+ Reliability (Often combined with quality)
    + High cost of interrupted power, e.g., hospital
    + Two common measures 
        + System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), average total time without power over a year.
        + Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI), average time without given your power is out.
        + Many more relating to frequency and cost of lost service.
    + You could have lower rates if you have an interruptible tariff.    


## Why Would I (Private) Build It? (Cont)

+ Peak reduction
    + If you have demand (kW) charges, your maximum use.
    + If you have a coincident peak (kW) charge, you use at system peak.

+ Cogeneration Opportunity
    + Already need Steam or Chill water
    + Electricity generation is a bonus
      
+ Reduction in volumetric (kWh) charges
    + Net metering just a bit to shave off the high block charges
    + Peak Pricing Tariff
    + Real-time Prices.
    + Nice subsidy.
    + Actually, social cost, cheaper.
    
+ The utility side is significantly more complicated.


## Why The Controvoursy

+ Limited markets for local reactive power.
+ Limited markets for local reliability.
    

## Three simple ways of thinking about costs

+ The Make vs Buy trade-off (TC).
+ The Minimum Efficient Scale (AC), i.e., volume such that AC is at a minimum.
+ Investment Delay, a time value of money concept.

With all cost estimates the key conceptual problem is to only look at incremental costs.

+ It is often unclear what those incremental costs are relative to.  
+ Cost does depend on your point of view.

## Example Make vs Buy

+ Assume cost functions of $C = F + \alpha q$ form.  
    + Fixed cost
    + Constant average variable cost
+ Make vs Buy:  Given known q, Choose the least cost technology 

## Example MES

+ Several definitions of MES
    + Quantity such that $MC=AC$.
    + Quantity such that AC decreases very little as quantity increases.

## Example Investment Delay

+ Pushing costs into the future can be valuable.
+ Value of delay increases as interest rates increase.
+ Exponential discounting $P = \frac{F}{(1+i)^N}$.


+ Example:  Maintenance expenditures of $100 a year forever. What is the value of skipping a year?
    + $PW(Maintance) = \frac{100}{i}$ At i = 10% this is `r 100/.1`.
    + Delay for 1 year is $\frac{\frac{100}{i}}{1+i}$. This is `r round((100/.1)/1.1,2)`. 
    + The difference is the savings.

## Report Example

![](Fig311.png)

## How Did We Get to the Current G-T-D Arrangment (MES Argument)

+ Both large scale and small scale originally existed.
+ Large scale developed
    + Lower AC
    + Higher MES
    + Speed of change up till 60s made this the dominant form.
+ Small scale continued to develop
    + Right sized scale and MES
    + Decreasing AC
    + 1978 Qualifying Facilities Era was when they could sell power under some conditions.

## Private Choice of Technology (Make vs Buy Argument)

+ Have access to utility power and DG.
+ Several States of Opportunity Costs
    + If you have no special needs and need to pay full cost of fuel.
    + If you have 'Free' access to fuel, e.g., wood chips, AC of DG is lower.
    + If power quality or interruption is not what is desired, AC of utility power is higher.
    + If you face a Peek, Time of Use or Demand Charge.
    + More complicated diagrams can be made but this works.

    
    
## Utility Point of View 

Please note that lots of power quality issues need to be solved on the D side, with capacitors and transformers. Power quality may actually get worse with new equipment and DG.

+ Utility: Supply customer needs with T+G or with DG. Trade-offs between the two in an isoquant/isocost sense.
+ Customer: Decide to take utility solution or provide with private DG. (Make vs Buy).

<!-- # Odd Diagrams and Points in the Report -->

<!-- ## Fig 3-4 -->
<!-- ![](Fig34.png) -->

<!-- ## What is Wrong? -->

<!-- + Need two diagrams, one for constrained DG and one for wholesale electricity market -->
<!-- + Confuses Reduced usage is Value to Participants with utility cost reductions and reduction in DWL. -->

<!-- ## Fig 3-7 -->

<!-- + Gives perfect competition result for a competitive public utility. -->
<!-- + Somehow, it can be rate of return regulated. -->
<!-- + Analysis should be that of a price ceiling with a reduction in demand and a reduction in the ceiling. -->

## What is going on NOW

By NOW I mean in the last three months.  Comments are rough because it is all very new.

+ Proposed rule for virtual power plants, though not by that name, as well as new definitions so DER can participate at the wholesale level. (Nov 17, 2016)
    + https://www.ferc.gov/whats-new/comm-meet/2016/111716/E-1.pdf
    + CAISO has had them for a few years http://www.caiso.com/Documents/Non-GeneratorResourceRegulationEnergyManagementImplementationPlan.pdf
+ New York is on the topic too. (Oct 27th, 2016) http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId={59B620E6-87C4-4C80-8BEC-E15BB6E0545E}

## The FERC NOPR is *very* political  

+ Appears timed to be in place before the FERC board turn over.
+ There is a procedure for rule making that involves months of notice and hearings.
+ Undoing requires doing this again.

##  The FERC Proposal

+ Elimination of Barriers to Electric Storage Resource Participation in
Organized Wholesale Electric Markets.

+ Participation of Distributed Energy Resource Aggregators in the
Organized Wholesale Electric Markets


## The Barriers

Please note that many market definitions vary by ISO/RTO.  FERC gives directions.

+ Rules are set up to accommodate existing technology:
    + How long they can provide service
    + How they provide service
    + Often restricted to regulation service 

+ Examples
    + ISO-NE requires registered Generator Assets to participate in all wholesale markets
    + Common vision of storage is pumped storage with under an hour use.

+ Some RTO/ISOs are better
    + PJM Energy Storage Resource Model
    + CAISO  Energy Storage Resource model
    
+ But all are found wanting by their own assessment or others that wish to participate.    

## Connection to Demand Response

Demand response is typically:

  + Things done on the consumer side of the meter
  + Remote turn of of equipment
  + Agreements to turn off with notice
  + Getting paid for not consuming electricity
    
The reason is that demand response is considered a residual definition, if not generation then demand response.

## Virtual Power Plants, aka, Aggregators

+ Typically there is a minimum size to participate in the wholesale markets.  Minimum size is defined by the unit.

+ Aggregation allows you to combine many small units and operate them as one large unit.

+ Common practice
    + Banks are savings agregators
    + Corporations are investment aggegators to accommodate small investments.


## The FERC Proposal for Participation Model

+ Electric storage resources must be eligible to provide all capacity, energy and
ancillary services that they are technically capable of providing in the organized
wholesale electric markets;

+ The bidding parameters incorporated in the participation model must reflect and
account for the physical and operational characteristics of electric storage
resources;

+ Electric storage resources can be dispatched and can set the wholesale market
clearing price as both a wholesale seller and a wholesale buyer consistent with
existing rules that govern when a resource can set the wholesale price;

+ The minimum size requirement for electric storage resources to participate in the
organized wholesale electric markets must not exceed 100 kW; and

+ The sale of energy from the organized wholesale electric markets to an electric
storage resource that the resource then resells back to those markets must be at the
wholesale LMP.


## Commentary Bidding Parameters

+ Not just about storage.  This is aiming for technology neutrality.

+ Bidding parameters could include things like state of charge, like CAISO and NYISO.
  + MISO is more detailed requiring hourly max levels, storage rates,etc.
  
+ Proposal is: "RTOs/ISOs establish state of charge, upper charge limit, lower charge limit, maximum energy charge rate, and maximum energy discharge rate"


    
    
## Commentary (Con't)

+ Balance between the additional costs and complexity to the ISO/RTOs and the benefits of technological development
    + Makes it harder to manage the grid.
        + NG that has connection to pipeline and backup diesel is easier to optimize than battery with limited storage.
        + It literally increases the mathematical difficulty and will require new models.  Basically, convert to pumped storage model.
    + May produce "Gresham's law"" power with increased market monitoring costs. 
    + New technology does not get developed unless there is a way for it to make money.
    
+ Spinning Reserves requires spinning, but batteries don't spin.


## Commentary, Buyer and Seller

+ Some existing limitations
    + MISO in real-time market but as demand response
    + NYISO as negative prices on generation side with other restrictions.
    
+ This is a proposal to submit bids as both a buyer and a seller in the same period.
    + Makes sense since this is a special feature of storage but;
    + ENRON did some manipulation of congestion pricing with this.  They did it through wheeling but there may be a dynamic analog.
    
## Commentary on size

+ Smaller than most ISO/RTO, CAISO is low with 10kW
+ 100kW puts high-end Teslas on the list.
+ 100kWh Powerpack, at $145K, with $52K inverter buys in.
+ Most DER is under this but with the aggregation rules, may not be an issue.


## No Arbitrage Rule or is it?

+ Avoids people buying at wholesale and then net metering.
    + I bet there is a way around this!
    + But they used the distribution network to get the power.
    
+ Need new rules for a firewall between the retail and wholesale markets.
    + Can I buy wholesale (G+T) to avoid retail (G+T+D)?
    
This will be where the next round of trouble will be.  How will the load serving entity, i.e., the utility survive?

## Aggregation, Virtual Power Plants

+ Idea
    + Get a bunch of small DER together.
    + Contract to control market interactions subject to limitations.
    + Pay them for their power/storage
    + Take a slice.

+ CAISO idea as far as I can tell but others have done it.
    + Was usually just demand response, i.e., getting paid for not using power.
    + NYISO puts limitations on the size of the individual units, less than 10kW.
+ Would allow more behind the meter storage, think PV to participate, but currently many limitations on them injecting power.


## Why this is really interesting.

+ LMP don't often provide the right incentives for new generation.
    + Prices are high now but
    + Once you enter, prices would be low.
+ This allow you to build a power plant for an area a bit at a time.
+ May offset some smart grid costs, the generator pays rather than the Load Serving Entity.
+ Connects with making the nodes as broad as possible to increase competition.
